Action: I'll read the CSV file containing carrier data for shipping Insulin to Phoenix. The CSV file has a header row, so I will access the second column ("Carrier Name") and extract its content. The third column ("Compliance Record") contains Yes or No values, which I can convert into True or False; and the fourth column ("Cost Comparison") is not numerical data but text based on "Yes" or "No", so it won't be used for this particular evaluation.
